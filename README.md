# SeeThroughWindows
Press a hotkey to make the current window transparent, allowing you to see through it!

Releases can be downloaded from https://www.mobzystems.com/Tools/SeeThroughWindows

The current release is 1.0.8, which runs standalone on .NET 8.0, so downloading .NET is no longer necessary.

Note: See Through Windows is Windows-only - it will not run on Linux or Mac!
