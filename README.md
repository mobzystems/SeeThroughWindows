# SeeThroughWindows
Press a hotkey to make the current window transparent, allowing you to see through it! Press hotkeys to minimize/maximize the current window, or to send it to another monitor (like Windows 7, except also if you don't have Windows 7)

Releases can be downloaded from https://www.mobzystems.com/Tools/SeeThroughWindows

The current release is 1.0.7, which runs standalone on .NET 6.0 so, no downloading .NET is no longer necessary.
